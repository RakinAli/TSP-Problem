# TSP Problem
Code to solve the TSP problem. Scored decent on the test on kattis however some possible improvements include:
- Randomised 2-opt
- Implement 3-opt
- Implement Christopides however instead of solving it with perfect-min-matching you use a heuristic instead
- Ant colony to find better 'starting' positions

Got 25 points, a C, with this small project.
